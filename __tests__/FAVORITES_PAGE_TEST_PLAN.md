# Favorites Page Test Plan

**Target Page**: `/app/properties/favorites/page.tsx`  
**Test Plan Version**: 1.0  
**Created**: 2024-09-01

## **Overview**

This document outlines a comprehensive testing strategy for the Favorites Properties page, following the same systematic approach used for the Profile page tests. The Favorites page displays user's saved/favorited properties in a grid layout with navigation breadcrumbs.

### **Page Analysis**

**Components Used:**
- `Breadcrumbs` - Navigation breadcrumbs
- `PropertiesList` - Main content component displaying favorited properties
- Authentication via `requireSessionUser()`
- Data fetching via `fetchFavoritedProperties()`

**Key Features:**
- Session-based authentication
- User-specific favorited properties display
- Breadcrumb navigation (Profile â†’ Favorite Properties)
- Property grid layout via PropertiesList component
- Empty state handling for users with no favorites

## **Implementation Strategy**

### **Phase Execution Order:**
1. **Phase 1**: Component unit tests (PropertiesList, PropertyCard enhancements)
2. **Phase 2**: Data layer tests (fetchFavoritedProperties, favorites actions)  
3. **Phase 3**: Page integration tests (full favorites page flow)
4. **Phase 4**: Snapshot tests (visual regression protection)
5. **Phase 5**: User interaction tests (navigation, UX flows)
6. **Phase 6**: Authentication and favorites system integration tests

### **Testing Utilities:**

- **Jest**: Test framework and mocking
- **Next.js Testing**: Server component testing utilities
- **User Event**: Realistic user interaction simulation

### **Key Testing Patterns:**
- Mock `requireSessionUser()` for authentication testing
- Mock `fetchFavoritedProperties()` for controlled data scenarios  
- Mock `PropertiesList` and `PropertyCard` for focused integration testing
- Use snapshot testing for visual regression protection
- Test empty states, error states, and edge cases comprehensively

## **Test Coverage Goals**

### **Total Estimated Tests: 130-165**
- **Phase 1**: 27-33 tests (Component enhancements)
- **Phase 2**: 18-22 tests (Data layer enhancements)  
- **Phase 3**: 32-40 tests (Page integration)
- **Phase 4**: 15-20 tests (Snapshots)
- **Phase 5**: 27-33 tests (User interactions)
- **Phase 6**: 22-27 tests (Authentication/favorites system)

### **Success Criteria:**
- All tests pass without errors
- TypeScript compilation clean (`npx tsc --noEmit`)
- ESLint warnings minimal (acceptable for test mocks)
- Comprehensive coverage of favorites page functionality
- Consistent patterns with existing profile page tests
- Security and authentication thoroughly tested

---

## **Notes**

### **Key Differences from Profile Page:**
- Focuses on property display/grid rather than user profile information
- Emphasizes favorites system integration over property management
- Uses existing PropertiesList component instead of custom display
- Simpler page structure but more complex property interactions

### **Reusable Components:**
- `PropertiesList` is used across multiple pages - tests should be comprehensive
- `PropertyCard` appears throughout application - favorites-specific behavior testing crucial
- `PropertyFavoriteButton` is key interaction component requiring thorough testing

### **Security Considerations:**
- User can only see their own favorited properties
- Session validation critical for page access
- Proper handling of property ownership in favorite button display
- Data privacy maintained across user sessions
